THIS FRAMEWORK IS WORK IN PROGRESS!

I am trying to add/learn content whenever I have free time.

Please note that the test scripts in "reference" folder comes from official cypress page -> https://example.cypress.io/
The reason I included them in my framework is to refer them quickly without going out of my IDE.
